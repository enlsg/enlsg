[Ingress: The Animation](http://ingressanime.com/en/) was released in Japan on 18th Oct 2018 via "+ULTRA" Fuji Television Network.
According to Netflix itself via Twitter, the global release of the english version of Ingress anime was supposedly on the 23rd Nov 2018.
But the day has come and gone and it's still not available on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80992853) as the placeholder site hasn't been updated.

Netflix support doesn't seem to know what's happening as well. The release date is likely to be pushed back to 2019, so everyone's got to wait a little longer.
