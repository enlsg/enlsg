Ingress year 6 Double AP event offically ended today at 0330h hrs SGT, which is one and a half hours later than the announced time.
During this 9 day event, we have seen many agents of both factions going out of the way to enjoy the double AP, and even way into the wee hours.
Many took this opportunity to recurse as well, and were able to power level themselves to L8 within a day or two.

Give yourself a pat on the back for the extra effort and until next year, everyone better start saving all the viruses and Soft Bank Ultra Link Amps.
