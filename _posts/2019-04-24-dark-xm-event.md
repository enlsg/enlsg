Between ![26 Apr 2019 1:00am](https://img.shields.io/badge/01:00am-26%20Apr%202019-orange.svg) and ![01 May 2019 1:00am](https://img.shields.io/badge/01:00am-01%20May%202019-orange.svg), create links totalling 5km, 50km, and 250km cumulatively to earn a new tiered medal! Portal decay rate will be affected and both factions have to work towards the goal of capturing 400,000 additional portals, with the reward of 3x AP during the June First Saturday.

Don't really understand how this "Dark XM" event works? Andrew Krug (Global Community Manager at Niantic, Inc.) took the oppotunity to clarify some misconceptions in his TG channel. 

1: A baseline measurement of the number of Portals owned by both factions globally will be taken at 10am PDT (UTC -7) on April 25th. Let's call this amount X.

2: Players need to capture and own X + 400,000 more Portals to unlock the ability to be awarded the Dark XM medal.

3: X + 400,000 Portals do NOT need to be owned on April 30th. Whenever X + 400,000 happens that will unlock the medal. But must be achieved no later than April 30th.

4: We will provide twice daily snapshots of how close to the X + 400,000 goal the players are (times tbd)

5: There are three tiers to the medal that represent the cumulative length of the links you make during the event. These tiers are 5km, 50km, 250km.

6: The medals are bronze, silver, gold and will count towards leveling.

7: You can achieve the gold with one link or lots of links. Creating one 250km link is just as good as ten 25km links. Creating 100 links that are 2.5km long will also work.

8: You can start making links immediately at 10am PDT on April 25th. You do not need to wait until the X + 400,000 threshold is achieved.

9: Portal decay will be increased but slowly return to normal.

10: The metric to track your links will appear in both Prime and REDACTED I am told.

11: The link distance will not freeze or stop when the X + 400,000 threshold is achieved. You will have until April 30th to make as many links as you can get the largest cumulative distance.

12: I reserve this last bullet point to add something I forgot because I am old and likely forgot something. Has anyone seen my wallet or keys?
