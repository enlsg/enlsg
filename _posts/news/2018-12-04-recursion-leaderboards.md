Niantic posted [leaderboards](https://storage.googleapis.com/ingress-events/recursionprime/Austin_leaderboard.html) for Recursion Prime, showing the agents with the most unique hacks in each city.

It's cool that Niantic can provide such additional stats for gameplay __because they can__. Let's hope Niantic makes this a norm for future anomalies!
