Get ready for another round of 2x AP weekend!

Here's the official announcement over at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bqx7ZzmjRmE/)

*Start Date:* Fri, 7 Dec 2018 0200hrs SGT
*End Date:* Tue, 11 Dec 2018 0200hrs SGT

Only certain actions qualify for the double AP; the criteria is somewhat similar to the previous Cassandra Neutralizrer Neutralizer event.

Resonator 1st-7th deploy: 2x AP
Resonator 8th deploy: 3x AP
Resonator/Link/Field destroyed: 2x AP

So start hogging resonators and bursters now!
