Niantic quietly made a change on their server side to enable 6 more unlockable medals for everyone.

As previously announced, "First Saturday" is a new medal awarded to agents who attend Ingress First Saturday events.
The other 5 medals were previously not display your agent profile if did not have them. However. it is now displayed as a unlockable badge.

"Prime Challenge" seems to be currently missing the Onyx tier. Perhaps it will added at a later time.
