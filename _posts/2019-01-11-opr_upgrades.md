The above is a screenshot taken from  [https://opr.ingress.com/upgrades/](https://opr.ingress.com/upgrades/){: target="_blank"}. Currently it is undergoing staged rollout, so local agents may not see the "Upgrades" tab yet. Clicking on the link now may redirect you back to the OPR landing page instead. EDIT: It's now live in Singapore as of ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Jan%2016%2C%202019%209:00am-orange.svg)

What is an "OPR Upgrade" and how does an "Upgrade" actually work? Here's the FAQ republished in full.

      <td>
         OPR Upgrade Rewards gives you the opportunity to earn priority Upgrades by analyzing Candidate Portals in OPR. Upgrades can be used to fast-track your own Candidate Portals that have been submitted.<br/><br/>

An Upgrade will be rewarded when you contribute to 100 Agreements. When you earn an Upgrade, it will automatically prioritize one of your existing Candidate Portals. The particular Candidate Portal which the Upgrade is applied to will be chosen at random from your available Candidate Portal submissions. If you do not have any pending Candidate Portal submissions, your Upgrade will be saved for future use. You can only have a maximum of 10 Upgrades saved for future use, so be sure to submit a new Candidate Portal and redeem an Upgrade before you reach this limit. You will be notified on the OPR homepage when an Upgrade has been awarded or redeemed, and you can see your most recent Candidate Portal submissions that have have been prioritized.<br/><br/>

Please note that Upgrades will only prioritize the Candidate Portal for a more timely analysis within OPR; the selection criteria will not change in any way.

  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
         You can save a maximum of 10 unredeemed Upgrades. Any agreements you contribute to beyond that will no longer be tracked towards future Upgrade rewards. Don’t forget to submit a new Candidate Portal and redeem an Upgrade before you reach 10 available.

  </tr>

         No. An Upgrade will be redeemed for a Candidate Portal in your existing submissions queue at random. If you have only one pending Candidate Portal, the Upgrade will be used on that submission.

  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
         When your analysis of a Candidate Portal ultimately aligns with the final decision reached by OPR -- regardless of whether it is approved or rejected -- you will receive an Agreement. These Agreements are currently shown as “Portals Created and Rejected” in the OPR stats area, accessible by selecting your profile photo. Please note that you will not receive Agreements for edits made to already existing Portals.

    <tr>

         No. Upgrades will only prioritize the Candidate Portal for a more timely analysis within OPR. The selection criteria will not change in any way.

  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
         There are many factors that play into the decision-time on any Candidate Portal, so it’s not possible to know how long it may take to reach a decision. Since your Upgraded Candidate Portal has been prioritized, rest assured that a decision will be made in a more timely manner than if it was not Upgraded.
