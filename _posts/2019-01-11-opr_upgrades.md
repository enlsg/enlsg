Currently it is undergoing staged rollout, so local agents may not see the "Upgrades" tab yet. How does an "Upgrade" actually work? Here's the FAQ published in full.

<table class="table table-sm">
<tbody>
  <tr>
  <th colspan="5" style="font-size: 1.2em;background:#ddd;color:black;">I don’t have any Candidate Portals to submit right now. How many Upgrades can I save for future use?</th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
         You can save a maximum of 10 unredeemed Upgrades. Any agreements you contribute to beyond that will no longer be tracked towards future Upgrade rewards. Don’t forget to submit a new Candidate Portal and redeem an Upgrade before you reach 10 available.
      </td>
    </tr>

</table>

<table class="table table-sm">
<tbody>
  <tr>
  <th colspan="5" style="font-size: 1.2em;background:#ddd;color:black;">Can I choose which of my Candidate Portals I want to redeem Upgrades on?</th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
         No. An Upgrade will be redeemed for a Candidate Portal in your existing submissions queue at random. If you have only one pending Candidate Portal, the Upgrade will be used on that submission.
      </td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table class="table table-sm">
<tbody>
  <tr>
  <th colspan="5" style="font-size: 1.2em;background:#ddd;color:black;">What exactly is an Agreement in OPR?</th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
         When your analysis of a Candidate Portal ultimately aligns with the final decision reached by OPR -- regardless of whether it is approved or rejected -- you will receive an Agreement. These Agreements are currently shown as “Portals Created and Rejected” in the OPR stats area, accessible by selecting your profile photo. Please note that you will not receive Agreements for edits made to already existing Portals.
      </td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table class="table table-sm">
<tbody>
  <tr>
  <th colspan="5" style="font-size: 1.2em;background:#ddd;color:black;">Is my Upgraded Candidate Portal more likely to be accepted?</th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
         No. Upgrades will only prioritize the Candidate Portal for a more timely analysis within OPR. The selection criteria will not change in any way.
      </td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table class="table table-sm">
<tbody>
  <tr>
  <th colspan="5" style="font-size: 1.2em;background:#ddd;color:black;">How long will it take for my Upgraded Candidate Portal to be decided?</th>
  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
         There are many factors that play into the decision-time on any Candidate Portal, so it’s not possible to know how long it may take to reach a decision. Since your Upgraded Candidate Portal has been prioritized, rest assured that a decision will be made in a more timely manner than if it was not Upgraded.

  <th colspan="5" style="font-size: 1.2em;background:#ddd;color:black;">Will Niantic Ops be directly reviewing Upgraded Candidate Portals?</th>

    <tr>
      <td>
         No, Upgraded Portal Candidates will go through the same OPR analysis -- they will simply be processed in a more timely manner.
      </td>
    </tr>

  <tr>
  <th colspan="5" style="font-size: 1.2em;background:#ddd;color:black;">Can Upgrades be used for Portal edits?</th>

         No, Upgrades can only be applied to Candidate Portals submissions.

         Yes! If you contribute to 100 Agreements, you will receive an Upgrade regardless of the current status of your performance.
