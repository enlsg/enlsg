Currently it is undergoing staged rollout, so local agents may not see the "Upgrades" tab yet.

        I don’t have any Candidate Portals to submit right now. How many Upgrades can I save for future use? You can save a maximum of 10 unredeemed Upgrades. Any agreements you contribute to beyond that will no longer be tracked towards future Upgrade rewards. Don’t forget to submit a new Candidate Portal and redeem an Upgrade before you reach 10 available.
