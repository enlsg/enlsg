At the center of the main screen you will see something blue and green with lines and highlighted areas. The small green and blue dots are the Portals, or the main actionable objects in the game. You, as an agent in this game, is to capture them, create links by linking two portals up, and make fields when you close then links up (three lines form a field!).

In the next section, we will guide you on some of the in game basis.
